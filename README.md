# Rdkit-recipes and stuff
A collection of notebooks with simple code for working with molecules in rdkit. 

Data cleaning with rdkit

Drawing molecules with rdkit

[Generating Morgan fingerprint](Fingerprints_from_df.ipynb) column (fps) from a SMILES column in a dataframe

[Calculating 2D descriptors](2D_descriptors.ipynb) (Here I used molfeat. It has to be installed, e.g. Conda install -c conda-forge molfeat, I found pip didn't install it readily).

Calculate a large number of descriptors [using Mordred](Mordred_Descriptor_Calcs.ipynb)

[Make fingerprints and also create cannonical smiles](makeFPs_CannonicalSMILES.ipynb)
